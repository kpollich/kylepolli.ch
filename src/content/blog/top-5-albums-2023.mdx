I love Carly, and I really enjoyed this follow-up to her 2022 album. This is a delightful pop album with great production.
_Psychedelic Switch_ is one of my favorite pop songs in a long time.

### _Beloved! Paradise! Jazz!?_ by McKinley Dixon

/>

I didn't listen to this album until the very end of the year, but I immediately understood the hype I'd been seeing. This is a tight 30-minute jazz rap album with phenomenal lyricism and excellent live instrument performances.

### _The Land is Inhospitable, and So Are We_ by Mitski

/>

_The Land_ is Mitski's best album to date, and it really exemplifies what makes her great: superb songwriting and beautiful vocal performances.

### _SCARING THE HOES_ by JPEGMAFIA and Danny Brown

/>

I absolutely love the completely off-the-wall production on this album. It's unique, in-your-face, and keeps bringing me back for more.

### _Zach Bryan_ by Zach Bryan

<Image height={240} src={ZachBryan} alt="Zach Bryan by Zach Bryan" />

Zach Bryan's self-titled album is a great look into where country music is heading in the new generation of "alternative country" artists who reject the bro-country aesthetic that's been in vogue for years. This album is a heartfelt display of Zach's tremendous songwriting talent.

### _the record_ by boygenius

<Image height={240} src={TheRecord} alt="The Record by boygenius." />

I'm such a big fan of Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus, and Julien Baker on their own, and this collaboration of theirs made up a big chunk of my listening in 2023. boygenius is a supergroup that really allows each musician to have her own moments and stand out, while embracing their excellent chemistry as a group, especially as vocalists.

And now, for my top 5.

## 5. _In the End It Always Does_ by the Japanese House

  alt="In the End It Always Does by the Japanese House"
/>

Amber Bain's 2023 album sets its emotive and introspective lyrics against lush, gorgeous production done largely by The 1975's George Daniel. This is an excellent follow-up to her also great 2019 album _Good at Falling_. The vocal performances, pianos, strings, and winds on this album create such a powerful, intimate atmosphere for Amber's potent lyricism.

Favorite track: _Sad to Breathe_

## 4. _Desire, I Want To Turn Into You_ by Caroline Polachek

<Image
  height={240}
  src={DesireIWantToTurnIntoYou}
  alt="Desire, I Want To Turn Into You by Caroline Polachek"
/>

_Desire, I Want To Turn Into You_ is an eclectic and masterful pop album that embraces Caroline Polachek's virtuosic vocalist abilities. Somehow, this album jumps from flamenco on _Sunset_ to drum-and-bass and a Dido feature on _Fly To You_ to a bagpipe solo on _Blood and Butter_ and it doesn't feel disjointed or messy.

Favorite track: _Welcome To My Island_

## 3. _After the Magic_ by Parranoul

<Image height={240} src={AfterTheMagic} alt="After the Magic by Parranoul" />

I had no idea what to expect going into this album from South Korean shoegaze musician Parranoul. I was totally blown away by this album's balance of total wall-of-sound shoegaze guitar, hooky melodies, and immersive atmosphere. When I put this album on, I feel compelled to listen to it from start to finish.

Favorite track: _Insomnia_

## 2. _Javelin_ by Sufjan Stevens

<Image height={240} src={Javelin} alt="Javelin by Sufjan Stevens" />

I was late to the Sufjan Stevens train overall, only beginning to listen through his discography in 2023. My timing was somewhat fortuitous, as he released _Javelin_ while I was working through some his classics like _Illinois_ and _Carrie and Lowell_. I was not prepared for _Javelin_, though.

This album is at once devastating and hopeful, expansive and intimate. It is personal, contemplative, and heavy. Sufjan Stevens masterfully channels his personal grief and struggle into an unforgettable musical experience.

Favorite track: _Will Anybody Ever Love Me?_

## 1. _PetroDragonic Apocalypse; or, Dawn of Eternal Night: An Annihilation of Planet Earth and the Beginning of Merciless Damnation_ by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard

<Image

  alt="PetroDragonic Apocalypse by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard"
/>

This album just absolutely rips. It's a high-energy, flawlessly performed thrash metal masterpiece with a consistent and well-executed concept. This is King Gizzard at their best, and for a band that puts out like 7 albums a year, this one stands above the rest.

Favorite track: _Motor Spirit_

And that marks the end of my list for 2023. I listened to a ton of great music this year, and it's challenging to narrow it down to a succinct list. I'm looking forward to a great 2024 in music!
