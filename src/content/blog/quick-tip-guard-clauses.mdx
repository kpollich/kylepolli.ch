There are a few things that I find come up more often than others in code review. Whether I'm the one doing the review, or I'm receiving code review from a peer, there are some things that are just more obvious to someone with an outside perspective. One of these things, I've found, is the concept of [guard clauses](https://wiki.c2.com/?GuardClause) or early returns.

Let's take a look at a block of JavaScript code as an example:

```js
function validateUser(user) {
  if (user.email) {
    const hasValidEmail = validateEmail(user.email);

    if (user.password) {
      const hasValidPassword = validatePassword(user.password);

      return hasValidEmail && hasValidPassword;
    }
  }

  return false;
}
```

Using `if` statements, we've set up some logic that translate to something like this:

> If a user has an email, then validate the email. If a user has a password, then validate the password. If the email and password are valid, the user is valid. Otherwise, the user is invalid.

It's a bit hard to translate this sort of structure into pseudocode or plain English as we've written it, but what if we flipped the script a bit. What if we start with the conditions that denote an invalid user instead?

> If a user doesn't have an email, they are invalid. If a user doesn't has a password, they are invalid. If a user has a valid email and password, they are valid.

Let's see if we can translate this into code:

```js
function validateUser(user) {
  if (!user.email || !user.password) {
    return false;
  }

  const hasValidEmail = validateEmail(user.email);
  const hasValidPassword = validatePassword(user.password);

  return hasValidEmail && hasValidPassword;
}
```

Now we've got a much more concise, more coherent method that's logically equivalent (proven by some [tests](https://codesandbox.io/s/guard-clause-tests-f0ehr)) to our previous one. This concept of "inverting" your conditions and pulling them up to the top of the method is called a "Guard Clause". Rather than nesting logic underneath positive/assertive conditions repeatedly, we can determine the negative conditions up front and bail out of a method right away.

When you're deep in the implementation of some logic, it can be hard to see opportunities to invert conditions like this. During code review, though, a fresh pair of eyes is great for identifying areas where this particular refactor can be made.
