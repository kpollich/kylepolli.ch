## Honorable mentions

### _Big Ideas_ by Remi Wolf

<Image height={240} src={BigIdeas} alt="Big Ideas by Remi Wolf" />

This is a really fun, funky album with tons of character. The vocals and horn parts are especially great.

Favorite track: _Wave_

### _Paradise Pop. 10_ by Christian Lee Hutson

/>

As a Phoebe Bridgers stan, I'm of course of a fan of her frequent collaborator Christian Lee Hutson. This album is full of phenomenal songwriting and beautiful poetry.

Favorite track: _Carousel Horses_

### _You Won't Go When You're Supposed To_ by Knocked Loose

/>

I am by no means a metalhead, at least when it comes to hardcore music like this, but this album was such a fun surprise for me. The level of intensity and energy is just off the charts. This albums grabs you hard and doesn't let go.

Favorite track: _Suffocate (feat. Poppy)_

### _Prelude to Ecstacy_ by The Last Dinner Party

  alt="Prelude to Ecstacy by The Last Dinner Party"
/>

I love the theatric and grandiose approach on this album. It reminds me of what's fun about Queen (in small doses - I generally can't stand Queen), and I love how "big" this album feels.

Favorite track: _My Lady of Mercy_

### _Older_ by Lizzy McAlpine

<Image height={240} src={Older} alt="Older by Lizzy McAlpine" />

I loved Lizzy's 2022 album _five seconds flat_ and _Older_ is an awesome followup. Things are a little quieter and a little more introspective this time around, which allows Lizzy's songrwriting and lyricism to shine. I also thought the instrumentation was great here, with lots of winds, strings and piano throughout.

Favorite track: _All Falls Down_

## 10. _What a Relief_ by Katie Gavin

<Image height={240} src={WhatARelief} alt="What a Relief by Katie Gavin" />

Katie Gavin of MUNA released her first solo album this year, and I really enjoyed it. This album is full of meaningful, intimate songwriting, powerful lyricism, and hooky melodies.

Favorite track: _The Baton_

## 9. _NO HANDS_ by Joey Valence and Brea

<Image height={240} src={NoHands} alt="NO HANDS by Joey Valence and Brea" />

I don't listen to much hip hop, but this goofy in-your-face Beastie-Boys-inspired album from Joey Valence and Brea was a ton of fun. As intense and powerful as the beats are, the lyrics don't take themselves too seriously. This album is such a good time.

Favorite track: _OMNITRIX_

## 8. _The New Sound_ by Geordie Greep

<Image height={240} src={TheNewSound} alt="The New Sound by Geordie Greep" />

It's great to see Geordie Greep deliver such an excellent album in the wake of Black Midi's fallout. Who would've thought a high-energy bossanova album full of songs about prostitutes would be so good?

Favorite track: _Holy, Holy_

## 7. _Tigers Blood_ by Waxahatchee

<Image height={240} src={TigersBlood} alt="Tigers Blood by Waxahatchee" />

I've listened to this album over and over since it released this year. There's a sort of comforting, laid-back feel to the songs on this record that keeps bringing me back for more. This album feels like returning home to a quiet town.

Favorite track: _Right Back to It (feat MJ Lenderman)_

## 6. _SMILE! :D_ by Porter Robinson

<Image height={240} src={SMILE} alt="SMILE! :D by Porter Robinson" />

I did not expect to like this chronically online, TikTok addicted zoomer energy album from Porter Robinson as much as I did but I'm glad I gave it a listen. There's a nostalgic feel to this album for the days of Motorola Razrs and emo music videos that I found really compelling. Porter Robinson ponders his own fame and the role of fanbases on the internet while sprinkling in those big electronic hits that he's known for.

Favorite track: _Russian Roulette_

## 5. _Imaginal Disk_ by Magdalena Bay

<Image height={240} src={ImaginalDisk} alt="Imaginal Disk by Magdalena Bay" />

This is an absolutely incredible pop album with fantastic production and huge instrumentation. The synth work on this album especially just has such a clean, tactile feel to it that scratches my brain in all the right ways. Then there's these huge hooks and great lyrics to top it all off. This album is just plain awesome.

Favorite track: _Death & Romance_

## 4. _Bright Future_ by Adrianne Lenker

<Image height={240} src={BrightFuture} alt="Bright Future by Adrianne Lenker" />

Adrianne Lenker continues to showcase her talents as one of the best songwriters alive. This album brings poetry and intimacy to the forefront, with sweet virtuosic guitar work and a beautiful, intimate atmosphere. I am eternally grateful for any time Adrianne shares the music inside her mind.

Favorite track: _Sadness As A Gift_

## 3. _Manning Fireworks_ by MJ Lenderman

<Image
  height={240}
  src={ManningFireworks}
  alt="Manning Fireworks by MJ Lenderman"
/>

I grew up on "alt country" music thanks to my dad's tastes, and this MJ Lenderman album takes me back to listening to Son Volt and Uncle Tupelo in my dad's Silverado as a kid. MJ Lenderman's lyricism is sardonic, witty, and tongue-in-cheek. His songs paint a picture of hometown high school dropouts flailing aimlessly through mediocrity, and the instrumental back drop is spacious and laid back.

Favorite track: _Wristwatch_

## 2. _Don't Forget Me_ by Maggie Rogers

<Image height={240} src={DontForgetMe} alt="Don't Forget Me by Maggie Rogers" />

This album along with _Tigers Blood_ above was among my most repeat-listened-to music this year. Maggie Rogers has found a perfect fit for her voice and songwriting with this kind of 2000's pop-rock sound. I feel like there's no situation where this album would feel out of place.

Favorite track: _The Kill_

## 1. _BRAT_ by Charli XCX

<Image height={240} src={BRAT} alt="BRAT by Charli XCX" />

After a pretty disappointing 2022 album in _CRASH_, Charli XCX could not have delivered a better followup than _BRAT_. This album is a revelation in pop music, and a success in nearly every way. There's a striking contrast between the "365 party girl" bangers on this album and the stripped down introspective moments in which Charli reflects on motherhood and femininity. This is an absolute triumph from Charli, and she has deserved every moment of her blow up in 2024.

Favorite track: _Sympathy is a knife_
