These are some of my favorite albums that I’ve been listening to so far this year in no particular order. I’ve been making a concerted effort to listen to more music this year, and I’ve got quite the backlog to work through, so I wouldn’t consider this an exhaustive or authoritative list by any means. I can’t wait to check back in at the end of the year with some more music!

## *The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess* by Chappell Roan

This is not a 2024 album (it released in September, 2023), but I've been listening to it constantly since I first saw Chappell Roan's [tiny desk concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4WiXKGCJhg) in March. This album is fun, well produced, and full of incredible vocal performances. Chappell has absolutely blown up this summer following her excellent single [*Good Luck, Babe*](https://youtu.be/1RKqOmSkGgM), and she deserves every bit of her success.

Favorite track: *Casual*

## *Bright Future* by Adrianne Lenker

Adrianne Lenker continues to demonstrate her virtuosic songwriting talents on her 2024 album. The poetry and musicianship on this album are both stunning, and there's really nothing to dislike here. I greatly enjoy the version of the Big Thief song *Vampire Empire* on this album, as well, with its "around the campfire" kind of vibe.

Favorite track: *Fool*

## *BRAT* by Charli XCX

This is a perfect pop album with perfect production. The bangers on this album bang hard, while the ballads are stripped back, honest, and vulnerable. I was surprised at the level of depth on this album lyrically, as well, and I think Charli's songwriting here really poignantly expresses how she feels as a woman in music. No skips, absolute heater.

Favorite track: *Mean girls*

## *Tigers Blood* by Waxahatchee

Waxahatchee (aka Katie Crutchfield) put out one of my favorite albums with 2020’s *Saint Cloud* and *Tigers Blood* is a great follow up that builds on that alt country sound. I love the songwriting here, the laid back atmosphere, and the lyrical storytelling. I’m a sucker for this southern americana sound, and this albums executes it exceptionally. 

Favorite track: *Evil Spawn*

## *Don't Forget Me* by Maggie Rogers

This is my favorite Maggie Rogers album to date, and her voice fits this kind of soft 2000’s rock style perfectly. The approach on this album seems to be “simple songs done to perfection” and it really works here. This is an album I keep coming back to this year. 

Favorite track: *The Kill*
